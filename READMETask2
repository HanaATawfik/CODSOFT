# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe AI project repository, developed as part of my CodeSoft AI Internship journey. In this project, I've implemented an AI agent that engages in the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. By employing game theory and basic search algorithms, I've designed an AI player that strives to be unbeatable.

## Project Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe is a deceptively simple game, but its strategies delve into the core of decision-making and algorithmic analysis. With this project, I've ventured into the fascinating territory of game AI, exploring how AI agents can effectively play games through intelligent decision-making processes.

## Task Description

The task involved implementing an AI agent capable of making optimal moves in Tic-Tac-Toe. To achieve this, I leveraged the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning. This algorithm ensures that the AI player considers all possible moves and counter-moves, striving to maximize its chances of winning or forcing a draw against a human player.

## Solution Highlights

Here are the key components of my solution:

- **Display Board Function:** A utility function to visualize the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board, ensuring clarity during the game.
- **User Turn Function:** Enables the human player to make a move by choosing a position on the board.
- **Evaluate Board Function:** Evaluate the current state of the board to determine a win, loss, or draw.
- **Minimax Algorithm:** I've implemented the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to enable the AI player to make optimal decisions while minimizing the number of explored paths.
- **AI Player's Turn:** The AI player's turn is managed by evaluating possible moves using the Minimax algorithm and selecting the best move accordingly.
- **Main Game Loop:** The main game loop orchestrates the entire gameplay, allowing the AI and human player to take alternating turns until the game reaches a win, loss, or draw state.

## Running the Code

To experience the AI in action, simply run the provided Python code in your preferred environment. The AI bot, represented by "O," will engage in a strategic battle against you, "X." The AI will endeavor to make the best possible moves to either win or force a draw.

## Learning and Future Directions

Through this project, I've gained valuable insights into game theory, algorithmic decision-making, and AI-driven gameplay. This experience has ignited my curiosity to explore more advanced AI strategies, explore different algorithms, and perhaps even extend the AI's capabilities to more complex games.

Thank you for joining me on this exhilarating exploration of AI in gaming. Feel free to delve into the code, experiment, and embrace the challenge of outsmarting our Tic-Tac-Toe AI! Your feedback and insights are greatly appreciated.
